***WORK IN PROGRESS***
> A simple, customizable, & configurable window manager (eyecandy.ehan.dev)

## The Idea

Most window managers are complex and lack proper documentation & are built in an un-modular way.

eyecandywm is an attempt to make an x11 window manager in seperate executables. Each executable would have a certain function and accept certain parameters.

These executables would be manually ran by the user when needed, and the indended use case is to have a keybinding system run the commands based on keyboard shortcuts, essentially letting the user create a DIY tiling window manager.

## The Plan
